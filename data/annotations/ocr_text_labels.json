As pointed out by Greenland and Maldonado [26], there are problems identifying the target population when using standard logistic regression analysis. Models were fit using EGRET [27]: statistical significance of individual terms was determined using the likelihood ratio test, and the goodness-of-fit statistic G² was based on the deviance. On purely statistical grounds the best-fitting model had main effects for OC, AGE and CIG, along with the interaction term AGE × CIG (G² = 12.0, df = 8, p = .15). The odds ratio estimate for the OCMI association was 2.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70,4.68). Of note, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio estimate, ORMH= 2.82 (95% CI: 1.70,4.69), was virtually identical to the logistic regression estimate. The ORMH confidence interval was based on the variance estimate described by Robins, Breslow and Greenland [28,29]. The model with main effects for OC, AGE and CIG, along with the interaction term OC × CIG also fit the data quite well (G² = 17.4, df = 10, p = .068).

We then conducted a weighted logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations, with MI as the dependent variable and OC as the sole independent variable. Following Hernán et al.

Complexation was found to be optimum when using a magnetic stirrer, a maximum of 71.79 ± 0.73% w/w for indion 234 and, in case of a rotary shaker, a maximum of 65.27 ± 0.54% w/w. This finding may indicate the significant involvement of van der Vaal’s forces taking place along with drug exchange during complexation. The drug loading in various drug:resin concentrations was found to be 71.79 ± 0.73% w/w, 78.24 ± 0.86% w/w, 83.82 ± 0.57% w/w for 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 ratio, respectively. Increase in drug resin ratio above 1:3 did not further increase the percentage drug loading. The % drug loading (w/w) with temperature of 30°, 35°, 40°, 50° and 60°C was found to be 76.82 ± 0.23% w/w, 83.82 ± 0.57% w/w, 88.52 ± 0.53% w/w, 93.87 ± 0.36% w/w and 93.34 ± 0.19% w/w, respectively. These figures reveal that as temperature increases, the percentage of drug loading also increases rapidly up to 50°C. Increase in temperature above 50°C did not further increase the percentage drug loading. Increased temperature during complexation increases ionization of the drug and resin. Higher temperatures tend to increase the diffusion rate of ions by decreasing the thickness of the exhaustive exchange zone. Also, at increased temperatures, swelling of the resin takes place. Due to swelling, the ionic sites are open for exchange of counter ions.",

After activation with acid treatment, the exchangeable ion on the resin is H⁺. Relative selectivity of H⁺ is least than other ionic forms and therefore it increases the percent complexation. The mode of complexation between drug and resin can be affected by pH of the media. Maximum drug loading on the resin occurs at pH 3.5; a maximum of 71.79 ± 0.73% w/w for indion 234. As pH increases above 3.5, percentage of drug loading decreases. pH of the solution affects both solubility and degree of ionization of the drug and resin. Results can be attributed to the fact that a cationic drug is ionized at lower pH value and hence demonstrates high binding capacity while at higher pH, the protonated fraction of cationic drug decreases and hence interaction",

Despite the antigenic variation, distinct Opa proteins can bind to a domain common to several human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) (Virji et al., 1996b; 1999). N. meningitidis Opa–CEACAM interactions occur most effectively with acapsulate phenotypes (Virji et al., 1996a; 1999). This observation, and similar inhibitory effect of surface sialic acids on integral outer membrane adhesin function observed in other studies also, has led to the postulation that downmodulation of capsule must occur during intimate adhesion and invasion of the host (Stephens et al., 1993; Virji et al., 1993a; 1995a; Hammerschmidt et al., 1996; Read et al., 1996; Virji, 1996; de Vries et al., 1996; Deghmane et al., 2000; Hardy et al., 2000). As acapsulate meningococci are highly susceptible to serum bactericidal activity, following blood infiltration, capsule upregulation or selection of capsulate phase variants would be required for survival.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] recommend empiric treatment for PID in sexually active young women (25 years old or younger) and other women at risk of STI (multiple sex partners or history of STI) if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, and if one or more of the following is appreciated on bimanual pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness. The limitation of this approach is that it fails to discriminate between the differential diagnoses of acute pelvic pain in reproductive-aged women. For this reason, the lower genital tract needs to be assessed for signs of inflammation. The cervical canal should be examined for the presence of yellow or green mucopus and friability. Microscopy of the vaginal secretions should be performed looking for leukorrhea (more than 1 leukocyte per epithelial cell). Evaluation for bacterial vaginosis (vaginal pH, clue cells, and whiff test) and trichomonas vaginitis is in order [3–6]. Finally, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis should be performed. If the cervix is normal and no white blood cells are noted during microscopy of the vaginal secretions, an alternative diagnosis should be investigated since this reliably excludes (negative predictive value 94.5%) upper genital tract infection [7]. Because the sensitivity of microscopy to detect Trichomonas vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e., culture or polymerase chain reaction method). Standardized diagnostic tests for Mycoplasma genitalium are not routinely performed. Empiric antibiotic treatment should be initiated in sexually active young women, especially those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no other causes other than PID can be identified and if the following minimum criteria are present on pelvic examination:",

    "PMC3197005_00004_213427.jpg": "It is believed that the increased RD reflects the demyelination degree while increased AD represents signs of axon loss [25, 28]. Although MS is classified as a myelin-related disease, several studies have reported loss of axons both in MS plaques as well as in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Axon loss can be less prominent than demyelination, but its importance is recognized in the pathogenesis of symptoms [37, 38].",

We neither have found significant differences in RD between MS CP and MS CI nor the DTI parameters have correlated with whole brain or CC lesion loads. Despite the fact that our relatively small sample can underestimate RD or lesion load differences, it is conceivable to hypothesize that other factors than demyelination itself or gliotic lesions can lead to cellular death and axon degeneration. Traditionally, the loss of axons in MS was associated with fiber transection due to inflammation and demyelination in the plaques, possibly conducting to Wallerian degeneration [38, 39], but more recent studies point that it might be an underlying diffuse axonopathy that contributes to the process of neurodegeneration [18, 20, 38].",

The transverse characteristic of this study only provides a static picture of a dynamic process. It is not possible to predict the previous cognitive performance and the precise neuropsychological decline of the patients, and some of them might have greater functional reserve, diminishing the power of those correlations- in this sample.

This process results in the recruitment and proliferation of fibroblasts, which ultimately leads to fibrosis. Advanced OB can include a spectrum ranging from partial to complete acellular fibrotic obliteration whereby only scar tissue remains of the airway lumen [16,17]. When BOS is diagnosed on the basis of a decline in lung function, the process of inflammation and fibrosis is usually at an advanced and irreversible stage and treatment options are limited [15].

Two mode-locked femtosecondpulse Ti:sapphire lasers (MaiTai HP and MaiTai HP DeepSee; Spectra Physics, CA, USA) set at 720 and 830 nm were connected to the laser-scanning microscope via two independent scanheads (Figure 2).

As a result, the effective NA was small and the focal volume was large. In addition, the laser intensity was increased to release much more caged glutamate and, therefore, to activate many more glutamate receptors near the focal volume than could be achieved at the diffraction limit [7]. This modification allowed effective induction of APs in cells near the focal volume.",

Within each pixel, laser-mediated photolysis at 720 nm was performed consecutively at 3 × 3 points using lateral intervals of 6 μm with a pulse-train duration of 9 ms (1 ms at each point) [7]. The mapping was performed at 3 different depths, each separated by 50 μm. Brain tissue scatters light, and the strength of scattering is described by the average length of the distance between scattering events (ls) [44]. To maintain constant laser power for photolysis (P = 32-35 mW) within the mapped plane at depth z from the slice surface, the laser power was adjusted to P/e^{-z/ls} before entering the tissue slice, with ls set to 80 μm. The focal plane was moved by regulating a piezo actuator (PI 721, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) attached to the objective (Figure 2 and Additional File 1: Figure S1A). In contrast to our previous experiments of 2pMAPG mapping to detect EPSCs, [7] Ca2+ imaging required a long time interval between each 2pMAPG (470 ms versus 100 ms) because Ca2+ transient decay (>200 ms) was much slower than EPSC decay (~20 ms). In addition, photobleaching of the fluorescence depended on the duration of imaging. Thus, the space between neighbouring 2pMAPG pixels was increased from 19 μm to 31 μm laterally and from 25-30 μm to 50 μm axially and the total number of 2pMAPG mapping pixels was reduced from 3072-5120 to 384.

Hog1 not only regulates initiation but also modulates other steps of the transcription process. Recent work indicates that other yeast signalling MAPKs such as Mpk1 modulate transcriptional elongation in response to cell wall stress. Similarly, mammalian MAPKs have also been found associated to coding regions of stress-responsive genes.

Once PTH is decreased to near the normal range and is maintained for at least 2–3 months, it is assumed that the hyperplastic PTGs have regressed, and pulse dosing can be replaced by daily doses of calcitriol typically in the usual dose range of 2.5–3.5 ng/kg or its equivalent twice weekly.",

The development of these compounds has been undertaken in an effort to find compounds that will suppress PTH in CKD patients with less risk for development of hypercalcemia than that with calcitriol. This was most important when calcium-containing gut phosphorus binders were widely used. With the advent of lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate, which is now widely used, this is less of an issue. These vitamin D analogues are catabolized much more quickly than calcitriol and have a very short half-life in blood due to diminished binding to vitamin D binding protein. The short half-life lessens the chance for hypercalcemia to develop from intestinal epithelial cell programming as only newly formed villar cells are affected by vitamin D metabolites. Various alternative mechanisms have been considered for “noncalcemic” actions of some calcitriol analogues, but the evidence for these is very weak. One of the potential down-sides to the use of these analogues is that because they bind somewhat poorly to the calcitriol receptor (VDR), large doses must be given to achieve the required level of PTH suppression; these large doses induce not only their own destruction, but also the catabolism of native calcitriol.

Indeed, using combined focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM), it has been shown that virtually all synaptic junctions can be identified regardless of the plane of the section (Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009, 2013; Kreshuk et al., 2011; Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2013). Tissue preparation involves fixation in aldehydes, osmication, en bloc staining with uranyl acetate, dehydration, and embedding in Araldite. Stacks of serial images are then obtained by automated FIB/SEM (Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009). Since image segmentation, quantification, and analysis of synaptic junctions in these stacks are all labor-intensive procedures, we have developed ESPINA, a software tool that greatly facilitates and accelerates these processes (Morales et al., 2011a). ESPINA makes use of the fact that presynaptic and postsynaptic densities appear as dark, electron-dense structures under the electron microscope. ESPINA uses a gray-level threshold to extract all the voxels that fit the gray levels of the synaptic junction. The resulting 3D object is irregularly shaped and flattened, and includes both the pre- and postsynaptic densities and their outer contours (Figures 1A–H). Here we propose a method to extract the SAS, (equivalent to both the AZ and the PSD), from these reconstructed 3D volumes, based on the extraction of interior surfaces from volumetric representations.",

This variability precludes the use of the techniques currently available, so we have developed a new method to overcome the difficulties associated with SAS extraction. We propose a hybrid solution that obtains the desired result very efficiently by a combination of a deformable template surface and a distance transform method.",

Distance transforms do not need any post-processing step, although the topology is not completely preserved, and it may be difficult to locate ridges if the shape is complex. To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a hybrid approach that is based on a distance transform method and a deformable template surface.",

Skeletonization algorithms (Hisada et al., 2001; Mellado et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2010) are simple to implement but, in our experience, they often require a final post-processing step that involves either a pruning operation or a surface reconstruction process. Thinning methods (Lam et al., 1992) eliminate external voxels from the 3D volume until a planar surface is obtained. Although they are also simple to implement and fast executions can be achieved, thinning methods do not preserve the topology of the object, and different results can be obtained depending on the order in which the voxels are removed. Voronoi diagram methods (Okabe et al., 2000) are based on partitioning and triangulating the 3D space. Internal surfaces can be obtained by incrementally removing triangles from the external surface of the volume. Voronoi diagram methods permit topology preservation, but they are computationally expensive in 3D, numerically unstable, and spurious branches must also be pruned at the end of the process.

The set of voxels with their corresponding distance labels constitute the distance map (Borgefors, 1986). By making use of the a priori knowledge about the shape of the synaptic junction, our problem can be simplified by first placing an initial planar seed or template intersecting the 3D object at the appropriate location, and then deforming this plane according to the shape of the synaptic junction and the distance map values. This approach provides a free-form surface, the SAS, which should fulfill the following criteria: (i) The SAS should lie entirely within the reconstructed synaptic junction, equidistant to its pre- and postsynaptic faces. (ii) The curvature of the SAS should reproduce the curvature of the 3D segmentation of the synaptic junction.

Sporadic human infections continue to occur in countries where A(H5N1) viruses have become endemic in birds, providing a persistent threat to global health due to the possibility of virus adaptation towards efficient transmission among humans and ensuing pandemic spread. Recent evidence from experiments with ferrets, a widely accepted animal model for influenza in humans, suggest that only a limited number of genetic changes is needed for airborne transmission of H5N1 viruses (Imai et al., 2012; Herfst et al., 2012).

Accordingly, HAs of the 20th century pandemic viruses (H1N1 in 1918, H2N2 in 1957, and H3N2 in 1968) evolved from their original recognition of avian α2-3-sialyl- to preferential α2-6-sialyl-receptor binding (Connor et al., 1994; Matrosovich et al., 2000; Glaser et al., 2005; Stevens et al., 2006b; Tumpey et al., 2007).

Indeed, after passaging the viruses five times in the allantois of embryonated chicken eggs, which contain only α2-3-sialyl receptors (Ito et al., 1997b), all three viruses (re)gained efficient agglutination of horse RBCs (Table 1). Passage in eggs did not, however, alter the agglutination patterns of other avian influenza viruses isolated from humans or poultry or seasonal human influenza viruses (Table 1). Plaque assays showed that the MDCK cell isolate and egg passaged variant of A/Vietnam/CL1/2004 and A/Vietnam/CL105/2005 exhibited similar growth characteristics in MDCK cells.",
    "PMC3820038_00001_3161923.jpg": "To identify amino acid changes in HA associated with the hemagglutination patterns of A/Vietnam/CL1/2004, A/Vietnam/CL105/2005, and A/Vietnam/CL2009C/2005, the sequences of HA1 of the MDCK cell isolates were compared with those following passage in eggs. A single amino acid difference was observed in the HA of each egg-grown virus (Table 2): Asp186Glu in A/Vietnam/CL1/2004, Val134Ala in A/Vietnam/CL105/2005, and Phe151Leu in A/Vietnam/CL2009C/2005 (H5 numbering). Changes in the first two viruses represented reversions to the avian H5 consensus sequence following egg passage. The consensus residue at position 151 is Ile rather than Leu. Interestingly, sequence analysis in the original clinical specimen revealed a subpopulation of 151Ile and not Leu (see below).",

Three fathers reported that they would prefer a mix of some sessions together and some separately, and two fathers reported no preference regarding separation or combination. One father commented that it ‘could be great to do both, but could see it as a little intimidating for an unconfident father – as mum is potentially with kids more of the time and might inhibit dad’s natural interactions’.",

Comments included that they had been able to ‘see the baby in a new way…and increase understanding of development’, and that they had been able to see features of their interactions with their children in the video playback sessions that they had not identified in real time.

The picture on the degree of father involvement was more mixed, with fathers describing marginally more cognitive stimulation, warmth and nurturing in their interactions, but less care-giving and supervision. This is in line with the selected targets of the intervention – to improve paternal sensitivity and responsiveness (here measured as ‘cognitive stimulation’, ‘warmth’ and ‘nurturing’).",
