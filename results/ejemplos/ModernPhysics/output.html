The units on both the space and time axes are the same, meters. A meter of time means the time required for light to travel one meter, Le. 3.3 X 10-*s.</p><p>when, along one line in space. Should we need the other two dimensions, e.g., in a consideration of velocity vector transformations, we can always use the Lorentz transformation equations.</p><p>Tn a spacetime diagram the space location of each event is plotted along the x axis horizontally and the time is plotted vertically. From the three-dimensional array of ‘measuring rods and clocks in Figure 1-13, we will use only those located on the x axis, as in Figure 1-19. (See, things are simpler already!) Since events that exhibit relativistic effects generally occur at high speeds, it will be convenient to multiply the time scale by the speed of light (a constant), which enables us to use the same units and scale ‘on both the space and time axes, e.g., meters of distance and meters of light travel time." The time axis is, therefore, c times the time 7 in seconds, ie., ct. As we will see shortly, this choice prevents events from clustering about the axes and makes possible the straightforward addition of other inertial frames into the diagram,</p><p>As time advances, notice that in Figure 1-19 each clock in the array moves verti cally upward along the dotted lines. Thus, as events A, B, C, and D occur in spacetime, fone of the clocks of the array is at (or very near) each event when it happens. Remember that the clocks in the reference frame are synchronized, and so the difference in the readings of clocks located at each event records the proper time interval between the events. (See Example 1-3.) In the figure, events A and D occur at the same place (x = 2 m) but at different times. The time interval between them measured on lock 2 is the proper time interval since clock 2 is located at both events. Events A and B occur at different locations but at the same time (i.e., simultaneously in this frame). Event C occurred before the present since ct = ~1 m. For this discussion we will consider the time that the coordinate origins coincide, ct = ct’ = 0, to be the present.</p><p>Woridlines in Spacetime Particles moving in space trace out a line in the spacetime diagram called the worldline of the particle. The worldline is the “trajectory” of the particle on a ct versus x graph. To illustrate, consider four particles moving in space (not spacetime) as shown in Figure 1-20a, which shows the array of synchronized clocks ‘on the x axis and the space trajectories of four particles, each starting at x = 0 and moving at some constant speed during 3 m of time. Figure 1-20b shows the worldline for cach of the particles in spacetime. Notice that constant speed means that the worldline has constant slope; ice, itis a straight line (slope = Ar/Ax = 1/(Ax/At) = 1/speed).</p></div></body></html>
