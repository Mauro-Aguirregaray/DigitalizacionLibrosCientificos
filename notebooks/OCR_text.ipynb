Maryland, USA) was used to deliver three groups of sequential pulses as follows: 3 × 18 V, 20 ms each; 3 × 26 V, 15 ms each; 3 × 18 V, 20 ms each. Embryos were reincubated for an additional 16 h, some followed by a 1 h pulse of BrdU (10 mM). Other electroporated embryos were reincubated for 2 h followed by explantation of isolated neural primordia (see below).',\n",

The late postprandial dumping syndrome accompanying gastrectomy is characterized by hypoglycemia principally due to excessive insulin release.

However, previous studies using ghrelin receptor antagonists and ghrelin-deficient mice have demonstrated that ghrelin in the pancreatic islets inhibits insulin release in an autocrine/paracrine manner and consequently regulate blood glucose levels [33, 34]. The late postprandial dumping syndrome accompanying gastrectomy is characterized by hypoglycemia principally due to excessive insulin release. The mechanism for excessive insulin release remains unclear, lack of the stomach-derived ghrelin could be implicated. If so, it is possible that upregulated pancreatic ghrelin compensates lack of stomach-derived ghrelin and',\n",

Moreover, as IFN-y, a key inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to increase adhesion receptor expression in a variety of cell lines (Kantor etal, 1989; Fahigren ef al, 2003), we first examined whether IFN-y increased expression of receptors for any of the three major meningococcal ligands on Chang cell surface. For this purpose, Chang cells were pretreated with IFN-y for 24 h, and the binding of a number of detined capsulate and acapsulate Nm phenotypes was studied {Table 1, Fig. 1). The data showed a consistent increase in binding of acapsulate Opa-expressing bacteria to IFNstimulated cells, but such effect was not observed on the binding of Ope-expressing bacteria or acapsulate pillated bacteria without Opa or Opc proteins (Fig. 1A).',\n",

The development of these compounds has been undertaken in an effort to find compounds that will suppress PTH in CKD patients with less risk for development of hypercalcemia than that with calcitriol. This was most important when calciumr-containing gut phosphorus binders were widely used. With the advent of lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate, which is now widely used, this is less of an issue. These vitamin D analogues are catabolized much more quickly than calcitriol and have a very short half-life in blood due to diminished binding to vitamin D binding protein. The short half-life lessens the chance for hypercalcemia to develop from intestinal epithelial cell programming as only newly formed villar cells are affected by vitamin D metabolites.*!* Various alternative mechanisms have been considered for “noncalcemic\" actions of some calcitriol analogues, but the evidence for these is very weak2!* One of the potential down-sides to the use of these analogues is that because they bind somewhat poorly to the calcitriol receptor (VDR), large doses must be given to achieve the required level of PTH suppression; these large doses induce not only their own, destruction, but also the catabolism of native calcitriol. Caleitriol analogues are much more expensive to use than calcitriol, which presently limits their application in veterinary medicin',\n",

The development of these compounds has been undertaken in an effort to find compounds that will suppress PTH in CKD patients with less risk for development of hypercalcemia than that with calcitriol. This was most important when calcium-containing gut phosphorus binders were widely used. With the advent of lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate, which is now widely used, this is less of an issue. These vitamin D analogues are catabolized much more quickly than calcitriol and have a very short half-life in blood due to diminished binding to vitamin D binding protein. The short half-life lessens the chance for hypercalcemia to develop from intestinal epithelial cell programming as only newly formed villar cells are affected by vitamin D metabolites. Various alternative mechanisms have been considered for “noncalcemic” actions of some calcitriol analogues, but the evidence for these is very weak. One of the potential down-sides to the use of these analogues is that because they bind somewhat poorly to the calcitriol receptor (VDR), large doses must be given to achieve the required level of PTH suppression; these large doses induce not only their own destruction, but also the catabolism of native calcitriol. Calcitriol analogues are much more expensive to use than calcitriol, which presently limits their application in veterinary medicine.',\n",

Skeletonization algorithms (Hisada et al., 2001; Mellado et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2010) are simple to implement but, in our experience, they often require a final post-processing step that involves either a pruning operation or a surface reconstruction process. Thinning methods (Lam et al., 1992) eliminate external voxels from the 3D volume until a planar surface is obtained. Although they are also simple to implement and fast executions can be achieved, thinning methods do not preserve the topology of the object, and different results can be obtained depending on the order in which the voxels are removed. Voronoi diagram methods (Okabe et al., 2000) are based on partitioning and triangulating the 3D space. Internal surfaces can be obtained by incrementally removing triangles from the external surface of the volume. Voronoi diagram methods permit topology preservation, but they are computationally expensive in 3D, numerically unstable, and spurious branches must also be pruned at the end of the process.

As pointed out by Greenland and Maldonado [26], there are problems identifying the target population when using standard logistic regression analysis. Models were fit using EGRET [27]: statistical significance of individual terms was determined using the likelihood ratio test, and the goodness-of-fit statistic G² was based on the deviance. On purely statistical grounds the best-fitting model had main effects for OC, AGE and CIG, along with the interaction term AGE × CIG (G² = 12.0, df = 8, p = .15). The odds ratio estimate for the OCMI association was 2.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70,4.68). Of note, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio estimate, ORMH= 2.82 (95% CI: 1.70,4.69), was virtually identical to the logistic regression estimate. The ORMH confidence interval was based on the variance estimate described by Robins, Breslow and Greenland [28,29]. The model with main effects for OC, AGE and CIG, along with the interaction term OC × CIG also fit the data quite well (G² = 17.4, df = 10, p = .068). Given that oral contraceptive use is the exposure of interest, it is reasonable – on substantive grounds – to consider this as the 'final' model. If so, because of the OC × CIG interaction, the model no.\",\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'Next, we conducted an analysis using the MSM-IPTW approach. To obtain regression weights, a standard logistic regression analysis of control data was performed, with OC as the dependent variable, and with AGE and CIG as the independent variables. The best-fitting model had only a main effect for AGE (G²= 5.06, df = 6, p = .54). We then conducted a weighted logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations, with MI as the dependent variable and OC as the sole independent variable. Following Hernán et al. [4] and Sato and Matsuyama [11], calculations were performed using the SAS procedure PROC GENMOD [30]. The odds ratio estimate for the OC-MI association was 3.34 (95% CI: 2.15, 5.21). Interestingly, when empirical weights were used instead of regression weights, the odds ratio estimate (which equals sOR) was 2.83 (95% CI: 1.82, 4.41). This is very close to the odds ratio and confidence interval estimates based on the standard logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel analyses.',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'DNA expression vectors employed were: pCAGGS-AFP, which served as control [95]; YFP-C1-Lyn (from Tobias Meyer); the specific Rho targeting construct p190-rhoB-C (GAP-RhoB; from Yi Zheng [59]); dominant-negative RhoB and RhoA lacking GTPase activity (N¹⁹-RhoA and N¹⁹-RhoB; from George Prendergast [58]); the C3-like ADP-Rybosyltransferase (from Klaus Aktories [96]); and xNoggin [97]. DNAs were subcloned into pCAGGS and either fused in frame to a GFP-encoding sequence or coelectroporated with control GFP. Experimental details are available upon request. DNA (3–5 mg/ml) was microinjected into the lumen of the NT of 15–18 somite-stage embryos at the level of the segmental plate and/or two recently formed somites. A four parameter PulseAgile square wave electroporator (PA-4000, Cyto Pulse Sciences, Inc. Maryland, USA) was used to deliver three groups of sequential pulses as follows: 3 × 18 V, 20 ms each; 3 × 26 V, 15 ms each; 3 × 18 V, 20 ms each. Embryos were reincubated for an additional 16 h, some followed by a 1 h pulse of BrdU (10 mM). Other electroporated embryos were reincubated for 2 h followed by explantation of isolated neural primordia (see below).',\n",

Rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was used at 1:500 in combination with HNK-1 or BrdU immunolabeling or combined with in situ hybridization for FoxD3, Snail2 or Sox9 [22–24]. Antibodies against intracellular or extracellular domains of N-cadherin were applied following methanol fixation as described [31]. Vinculin antibodies were from the Hybridoma Bank. Filamentous actin was visualized with phalloidin. RhoA was visualized with two different antibodies: 26C4 (monoclonal SC418; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or rat monoclonal Lulu51 [101]. Likewise, RhoB was evidenced with polyclonal antibody 119 (SC-180; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with an anti-RhoB monoclonal antibody from the Hybridoma Bank [40]. All antibodies were found to specifically recognize their respective antigens [40,101]. For visualization of Rho proteins, explants were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid as previously described [101]. The active, GTP-bound form of Rho was localized using GST-Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (RBD-GST, Cytoskeleton, Inc.) as previously described [102]. Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst. Embryo sections and explants were photographed using a DP70 (Olympus) cooled CCD digital camera mounted on a BX51 microscope (Olympus).',\n",

During a respiratory cycle, the lung nonrigidly deforms its shape and individual lobes rotate independent of each other [2]. Branchpoints of the vascular tree can serve as possible landmarks inside the lung. Even though the registration may require separation of arterial and venous trees, segmentation of the entire vascular trees provides branchpoint information required for this purpose. Eventually the arterial and venous trees can readily be separated by scanning during the infusion of iodinated contrast agent and scanning during the arterial phase of the infusion.',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'Several 3D vessel segmentation algorithms have been presented to date. Tube enhancement filters based on a combination of the eigenvalues of a Hessian matrix have been reported in [3–5]. Segmentation can be performed simply by thresholding of the filter output. The filters have an ability to handle a range of radii by multiscale implementation. Lorigo et al. [6] reported a vessel segmentation algorithm based on a “codimension two” level set method. Vasilevskiy and Siddiqi [7] used gradient flows implemented using a level set method for 2D and 3D vessel segmentation. Aylward and Bullitt [8] reported an intensity ridge traversal method to extract vessels. A tracking direction was estimated by an eigenvector of the Hessian matrix at each tracking front position. Boldak et al. reported model-based vessel tracking [9]. Mayer et al. presented pulmonary vessel segmentation in contrast-enhanced CT data [10]. Fridman et al. [11] used cores [12, 13] to track the vascular tree from a seed point. Agam et al. reported a method for vascular tree segmentation using correlation-based enhancement filters and a fuzzy shape representation of the data [14]. An approach based on mathematical morphology and discrete geometry operators was recently reported in [15].

Our goal outlined in this paper has been to develop an algorithm that extracts peripheral thin segments as well as thick segments from thoracic CT images with better connectivity. The major contribution of the reported work is the development of an algorithm which extracts detailed pulmonary vascular trees by a novel integration of the tube enhancement filter and vessel traversal approaches. Our approach builds on several previously developed and proven methods for vessel enhancement and vessel traversal. However, when applying these algorithms individually to extract pulmonary vessels, several additional issues need to be resolved, which is the topic of this paper. The presented method integrates existing conceptual modules in a way that the final approach is free of the inherent limitations of the individual building blocks.',\n",

Suppose that the eigenvalues meet the condition λ₁ ≤ λ₂ ≤ λ₃. Based on the model, when a point is close to the center of a segment, λ₁ and λ₂ take on large negative values whereas λ₃ takes on a small value.

An analysis of the sample with A and B-horizons is shown in Table 7. The observed values of the PAH concentrations in the B-horizon were similar to the concentrations in the A-horizon. The values were in the range that was observed for typical concentrations in urban soils (0.600-3.000 mg/kg), and they are higher than typical concentrations in forest and rural soils (up to 1.000 mg/kg) [25]. We do not know the full history of the site, but the relatively high PAH concentration values show an influence due to human activity.

In another line of experiments, at 12ᵗʰ postoperative week fasting markedly increased plasma ghrelin levels in gastrectomized rats, indicating that the tissue other than stomach, most likely the duodenum, secretes ghrelin in response to fasting, the physiological regulator of ghrelin secretion [9, 32]. Furthermore, the feeding response to peripheral ghrelin administration was once eliminated by gastrectomy but restored at 12ᵗʰ postoperative week. These data suggest that ghrelin can be released and stimulate food intake under fasted conditions at this later period after gastrectomy. Collectively, the markedly upregulated production of ghrelin in the duodenum could contribute to the recovery of food intake and body weight in the later postoperative period.',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'In this study, ghrelin production was also significantly elevated in the pancreas. Since the ghrelin content in the pancreas and its increment due to gastrectomy are much smaller than those in the duodenum, they may neither significantly contribute to the circulating ghrelin levels nor operate endocrine functions. However, previous studies using ghrelin receptor antagonists and ghrelin-deficient mice have demonstrated that ghrelin in the pancreatic islets inhibits insulin release in an autocrine/paracrine manner and consequently regulate blood glucose levels [33, 34]. The late postprandial dumping syndrome accompanying gastrectomy is characterized by hypoglycemia principally due to excessive insulin release. The mechanism for excessive insulin release remains unclear, lack of the stomach-derived ghrelin could be implicated. If so, it is possible that upregulated pancreatic ghrelin compensates lack of stomach-derived ghrelin and',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'with resin also decreases.[11] Hence, Ondansetron HCl as a cationic drug will have maximum solubility and complete ionization in this range. Decreased complexation at lower pH, i.e. below 2, is due to excess H⁺ ions in solution, which have a higher binding affinity to the –COO⁻ group of the resin and compete with the drug for binding. Complexation was found to be optimum when using a magnetic stirrer, a maximum of 71.79 ± 0.73% w/w for indion 234 and, in case of a rotary shaker, a maximum of 65.27 ± 0.54% w/w. This finding may indicate the significant involvement of van der Vaal’s forces taking place along with drug exchange during complexation. The drug loading in various drug:resin concentrations was found to be 71.79 ± 0.73% w/w, 78.24 ± 0.86% w/w, 83.82 ± 0.57% w/w for 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 ratio, respectively. Increase in drug resin ratio above 1:3 did not further increase the percentage drug loading. The % drug loading (w/w) with temperature of 30°, 35°, 40°, 50° and 60°C was found to be 76.82 ± 0.23% w/w, 83.82 ± 0.57% w/w, 88.52 ± 0.53% w/w, 93.87 ± 0.36% w/w and 93.34 ± 0.19% w/w, respectively. These figures reveal that as temperature increases, the percentage of drug loading also increases rapidly up to 50°C. Increase in temperature above 50°C did not further increase the percentage drug loading. Increased temperature during complexation increases ionization of the drug and resin. Higher temperatures tend to increase the diffusion rate of ions by decreasing the thickness of the exhaustive exchange zone. Also, at increased temperatures, swelling of the resin takes place. Due to swelling, the ionic sites are open for exchange of counter ions.',\n",

After activation with acid treatment, the exchangeable ion on the resin is H⁺. Relative selectivity of H⁺ is least than other ionic forms and therefore it increases the percent complexation. The mode of complexation between drug and resin can be affected by pH of the media. Maximum drug loading on the resin occurs at pH 3.5; a maximum of 71.79 ± 0.73% w/w for indion 234. As pH increases above 3.5, percentage of drug loading decreases. pH of the solution affects both solubility and degree of ionization of the drug and resin. Results can be attributed to the fact that a cationic drug is ionized at lower pH value and hence demonstrates high binding capacity while at higher pH, the protonated fraction of cationic drug decreases and hence interaction',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'The Opa proteins belong to an antigenically and phase-variable family of adhesins encoded by three to four independent genes in N. meningitidis and by up to 11 genes in N. gonorrhoeae (Aho et al., 1991; Bhat et al., 1991; Hobbs et al., 1994). Despite the antigenic variation, distinct Opa proteins can bind to a domain common to several human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) (Virji et al., 1996b; 1999). N. meningitidis Opa–CEACAM interactions occur most effectively with acapsulate phenotypes (Virji et al., 1996a; 1999). This observation, and similar inhibitory effect of surface sialic acids on integral outer membrane adhesin function observed in other studies also, has led to the postulation that downmodulation of capsule must occur during intimate adhesion and invasion of the host (Stephens et al., 1993; Virji et al., 1993a; 1995a; Hammerschmidt et al., 1996; Read et al., 1996; Virji, 1996; de Vries et al., 1996; Deghmane et al., 2000; Hardy et al., 2000). As acapsulate meningococci are highly susceptible to serum bactericidal activity, following blood infiltration, capsule upregulation or selection of capsulate phase variants would be required for survival. However, more recent investigations using cell lines transfected with human CEACAM1 gene demonstrated Opa-mediated adhesion of apparently fully capsulate bacteria to cells expressing high levels of CEACAM1 (Virji et al., 1996b; Bradley et al., 2005; Rowe et al., 2007).',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'In order to assess how IFN-g treatment affected adhesion of Opa-expressing and Opa-deficient capsulate bacteria, we used several derivatives of the serogroup B strain MC58 isolate #18.18 (Pil<sub>+</sub>, Opa<sub>+</sub>, Opc<sub>+</sub>) as well as its Opa<sup>-</sup> and pil<sup>-</sup> derivatives (Table 1). In this case also, increased adhesion of Opa-expressing but not Opa-deficient bacteria was observed when using IFN-g-treated cells. Moreover, as for acapsulate phenotype, although pili clearly contribute significantly to Chang cell adhesion, pilus-mediated adhesion of #18.18Opa<sup>-</sup> (Pil<sub>+</sub> Opc<sub>+</sub> phenotype) did not increase after IFN-g treatment (Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that, in unstimulated Chang cells, adhesion appears to be primarily due to pili, whereas with IFN-g-stimulated cells, significant increase in binding of Opa<sub>+</sub> Pil<sub>+</sub> bacteria (#18.18), but not Opa<sup>-</sup> Pil<sub>+</sub> (#18.18Opa<sup>-</sup>), bacteria can be seen. In the absence of pili (#18.18Pil<sup>-</sup>), bacterial adhesion is greatly reduced for untreated Chang cells. Further, even though the binding of this phenotype is modest, increased interactions can be seen with IFN-g-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B and C).',\n",

The extracellular matrix produced by these scar-associated cells contains a number of molecules that inhibit axonal regrowth [10] of which chondroitin-sulfated (CS) proteoglycans (PG) are the major inhibitory molecules synthesized by reactive astrocytes. CSPGs consist of a protein core to which glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains are attached. Much of the evidence suggests that the inhibitory activity of CSPGs is derived from their CS GAG side chains, as treatments with chondroitinase ABC (which cleaves these chains) reduces CSPG inhibition to neurites in vitro [11] and regenerating axons in vivo [12].',\n",

The rare HPA-13b is related to the substitution of Thr799 located within a b-strand in the calf1 domain, facing the solvent (Fig. 1C). This position, which corresponds to Asp636 in aIIb, shows intermediate conservation, yet is occupied by the polymorphic methionine in other a-integrins, suggesting tolerance to such substitution. HPA-17, affecting Thr1087, is located at the C-terminus of the calf2 domain.

       "  'ground_truth': 'Bille et al. (2007) reported the association between oral clefts and first trimester maternal lifestyle factors utilizing the Danish record population that includes 100,000 pregnancies. There were 192 mothers in this cohort that gave birth to a child with an oral cleft. The investigators reported that first trimester smoking was associated with an increased risk of clefting, OR = 1.5 (95% CI = 1.05–2.14). Evaluation of the risks of coffee, tea, and alcohol found OR = 1.0; however, the data were not statistically significant. The authors reported an association of drinking five or more cups of tea per day early in pregnancy among the mothers of 58 children with cleft palate only, OR = 2.9, 95% CI (1.1–5.6) for infants with isolated only cleft palate. No significant association was found with maternal coffee or cola drinking in this study among the mothers of children with cleft palate, and no associations were found among the mothers of 134 infants with cleft lip with or without cleft palate and consumption of any caffeinated beverage. Bille et al. concluded, ‘‘There is no solid evidence to support caffeine as a risk factor in humans for oral clefts’’ (Rosenberg et al., 1982; Levitan and Cowan, 2002; Nawrot et al., 2003). The authors also conducted sub-analyses restricted to nonsyndromic cases, which may be etiologically distinct from oral clefts that occur as part of a syndrome. In fact, this may be the incorrect approach because most teratogens produce syndromes and genetic abnormalities are an important contributor to the occurrence of isolated cleft lip and cleft palate.',\n",

For mothers who consumed 10 to 99 mg of caffeine per day, there was also a significant association with maternal intake of 100 mg of caffeine per day or more among the mothers of 657 infants with isolated cleft palate only (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.0–1.6). The lack of correction for multiple comparisons and lack of a dose effect with these associations makes a causal relationship less likely. Selecting isolated clefting malformations as potentially being produced by in utero exposure to caffeine is problematic. This malformation, which has an important genetic contribution and is frequently an isolated malformation, is unlikely to result from exposure to a teratogenic agent, since known causes of cleft palate from teratogens are syndromic (anticonvulsants, alcohol, aminopterin, and retinoids).',\n",

The investigators found an association with maternal consumption of the equivalent of three or more cups of coffee per day (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.06–1.93).

Echocardiography is considered the standard monitor for estimating the LV function at the bedside in the intensive care unit. However, it requires a trained operator and is not a real-time monitoring tool. For monitoring of the systolic function, the pulmonary artery catheter has been the gold standard for a long time. However, now there are alternatives to this device, with transpulmonary thermodilution being one of them. This paper provides an overview of the usefulness of the transpulmonary thermodilution-derived indices for assessing systolic function at the bedside.',\n",

This type of monitoring gives the physician a rapid and accurate etiologic diagnosis of the cause of hemodynamic instability in the critically ill patient. Thus, a hemodynamically unstable patient is a good reason to perform a cardiac ultrasound [1]. However, the use of echocardiography requires an expensive device and a trained operator. Additionally, conventional echocardiography cannot be considered as continuous monitoring, and although there is a commercially available continuous model, it has not received widespread acceptance.',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'More recently, the transpulmonary thermodilution technique with single thermal indicator (incorporated into the PiCCO monitor, Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Germany) was proposed as a “less invasive” hemodynamic monitoring system for critically care patients. The system provides intermittent (transpulmonary thermodilution-derived) and continuous (pulse contour-derived) assessment of cardiac output and estimations of intrathoracic volumes (intrathoracic blood volume, global-end diastolic volume, and extravascular lung water). Accuracy of cardiac output calculation using the PiCCO system has been demonstrated in several clinical studies [5–9] and intrathoracic blood volume (blood volume contained in the heart and in the intrathoracic vessels) and global end-diastolic volume (the volume of blood contained in the four cardiac chambers at the end of the diastole) have been shown to provide reliable and more sensitive estimates of cardiac preload than cardiac filling pressures obtained with the central venous and pulmonary artery catheters [10–17]. On the other hand, the use of the transpulmonary thermodilution arterial catheters do not increase the risk of complications when compared with the commonly used short peripheral arterial catheters or pulmonary artery catheters [18].',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'tenderness in the case of salpingitis. Cervical motion tenderness is another common finding in women with PID. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] recommend empiric treatment for PID in sexually active young women (25 years old or younger) and other women at risk of STI (multiple sex partners or history of STI) if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, and if one or more of the following is appreciated on bimanual pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness. The limitation of this approach is that it fails to discriminate between the differential diagnoses of acute pelvic pain in reproductive-aged women. For this reason, the lower genital tract needs to be assessed for signs of inflammation. The cervical canal should be examined for the presence of yellow or green mucopus and friability. Microscopy of the vaginal secretions should be performed looking for leukorrhea (more than 1 leukocyte per epithelial cell). Evaluation for bacterial vaginosis (vaginal pH, clue cells, and whiff test) and trichomonas vaginitis is in order [3–6]. Finally, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis should be performed. If the cervix is normal and no white blood cells are noted during microscopy of the vaginal secretions, an alternative diagnosis should be investigated since this reliably excludes (negative predictive value 94.5%) upper genital tract infection [7]. Because the sensitivity of microscopy to detect Trichomonas vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e., culture or polymerase chain reaction method). Standardized diagnostic tests for Mycoplasma genitalium are not routinely performed. Empiric antibiotic treatment should be initiated in sexually active young women, especially those at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no other causes other than PID can be identified and if the following minimum criteria are present on pelvic examination:',\n",

At present, the most prevailing methods for TCM research are mainly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). With these techniques, metabonomics will help to understand syndromes, efficacy and toxicity of TCM. However, every analytical technique has its advantages and drawbacks, and there exist some obstacles of its applications on TCM. So, we discuss metabonomics in TCM and analyze some problems of its applications to study TCM in recent years. We believe that with the further development of metabonomic analytical technology, especially multianalysed techniques, metabonomics will greatly promote TCM research and be beneficial to the modernization of TCM.',\n",

Nowadays, due to the reliable therapeutic efficacy, TCM has become popular worldwide. However, unique theory system, evident treatment effectiveness, and difficulty to analyze scientific definition hinder the development of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Some problems, such as poor quality control, complex active ingredients, and unclear therapeutic mechanisms, still need to be resolved. So, it is important to interpret TCM theory by modern science and technology [1, 2].',\n",

As a systemic approach, metabonomics adopts a “top-down” strategy to reflect the function of organisms from terminal symptoms of metabolic network and understand metabolic changes of a complete system caused by interventions in a holistic context [6]. This perfectly coincides with the holistic thinking of TCM [7, 8]. So, the international and domestic scholars have successively studied the key scientific issues in TCM with metabonomic technology, including syndrome, differential treatment of the individual, synthetic effect of Chinese medicine as a whole in TCM, resources and quality control of Chinese Medicine. These researches demonstrated that metabonomics plays an increasingly important role in the study of TCM. Therefore, this paper discusses some metabonomic applications on TCM and analyses some obstacles of their applications on TCM in recent years.',\n",

We neither have found significant differences in RD between MS CP and MS CI nor the DTI parameters have correlated with whole brain or CC lesion loads. Despite the fact that our relatively small sample can underestimate RD or lesion load differences, it is conceivable to hypothesize that other factors than demyelination itself or gliotic lesions can lead to cellular death and axon degeneration. Traditionally, the loss of axons in MS was associated with fiber transection due to inflammation and demyelination in the plaques, possibly conducting to Wallerian degeneration [38, 39], but more recent studies point that it might be an underlying diffuse axonopathy that contributes to the process of neurodegeneration [18, 20, 38].',\n",

The sustained attention and IPS domain presented other tests with a tendency to correlate with the DTI parameters: SDMT with MD and RD, TMT with AD, and Stroop test with FA and RD. The transverse characteristic of this study only provides a static picture of a dynamic process. It is not possible to predict the previous cognitive performance and the precise neuropsychological decline of the patients, and some of them might have greater functional reserve, diminishing the power of those correlations- in this sample. Additionally, slight differences in the AD within the MS patients were present, which suggests different degrees of axon loss. These findings',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'After lung transplantation, the major limitation on long-term survival is the development of chronic rejection in the form of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) or its clinical surrogate marker, the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) [14]. OB is characterised by inflammation and remodelling of the pulmonary epithelium of the small airways [15]. This process results in the recruitment and proliferation of fibroblasts, which ultimately leads to fibrosis. Advanced OB can include a spectrum ranging from partial to complete acellular fibrotic obliteration whereby only scar tissue remains of the airway lumen [16,17]. When BOS is diagnosed on the basis of a decline in lung function, the process of inflammation and fibrosis is usually at an advanced and irreversible stage and treatment options are limited [15]. This emphasises the need for biomarkers that predict the development of BOS before a decline in lung function has occurred.',\n",

The genotype distributions of the four SNPs in CAV1 in the different groups are reported in Table 2. All SNPs were found to be polymorphic and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The genotype distribution of rs3807989 was significantly different between BOSpos and BOSneg patients (P = 0.015), which is related to a significantly higher minor allele frequency of rs3807989 in BOSpos patients than in BOSneg patients (minor allele frequency 0.58 vs 0.35; P = 0.027). Homozygotes of this minor allele had an increased risk of developing BOS compared with carriers of the major allele (odds ratio, 6.13; P = 0.0013; 95% confidence interval, 1.85 to 20.41).

This adjustment was achieved by using a motor-driven stage (SGSP20-85; Sigma-Koki, Tokyo, Japan) to change the distance between the two convex lenses in the optical pathway prior to entering the scanhead (Figure 2). As a result, the effective NA was small and the focal volume was large. In addition, the laser intensity was increased to release much more caged glutamate and, therefore, to activate many more glutamate receptors near the focal volume than could be achieved at the diffraction limit [7].

       "  'ground_truth': 'For 2pMAPG mapping, 128 pixels (16 × 8, spaced 31 μm apart) were scanned. Within each pixel, laser-mediated photolysis at 720 nm was performed consecutively at 3 × 3 points using lateral intervals of 6 μm with a pulse-train duration of 9 ms (1 ms at each point) [7]. The mapping was performed at 3 different depths, each separated by 50 μm. Brain tissue scatters light, and the strength of scattering is described by the average length of the distance between scattering events (ls) [44]. To maintain constant laser power for photolysis (P = 32-35 mW) within the mapped plane at depth z from the slice surface, the laser power was adjusted to P/e^{-z/ls} before entering the tissue slice, with ls set to 80 μm. The focal plane was moved by regulating a piezo actuator (PI 721, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) attached to the objective (Figure 2 and Additional File 1: Figure S1A). In contrast to our previous experiments of 2pMAPG mapping to detect EPSCs, [7] Ca2+ imaging required a long time interval between each 2pMAPG (470 ms versus 100 ms) because Ca2+ transient decay (>200 ms) was much slower than EPSC decay (~20 ms). In addition, photobleaching of the fluorescence depended on the duration of imaging. Thus, the space between neighbouring 2pMAPG pixels was increased from 19 μm to 31 μm laterally and from 25-30 μm to 50 μm axially and the total number of 2pMAPG mapping pixels was reduced from 3072-5120 to 384. In order to keep the number of AP-evoking pixels during this rough mapping similar to that in our prior report (~8), the focal volume for 2pMAPG was increased approximately threefold from the previous experiments [7].',\n",

Exposure of yeast to high osmolarity results in activation of the p38-related MAPK Hog1, which plays a key role in reprogramming the gene expression pattern required for cell survival upon osmostress. Hog1 not only regulates initiation but also modulates other steps of the transcription process. Recent work indicates that other yeast signalling MAPKs such as Mpk1 modulate transcriptional elongation in response to cell wall stress. Similarly, mammalian MAPKs have also been found associated to coding regions of stress-responsive genes. In this paper, significant progress in MAPK-regulated events that occur during the transcriptional elongation step is summarized, and future directions are discussed. We expect that the principles learned from these studies will provide a new understanding of the regulation of gene expression by signalling kinases.',\n",

MAPK modules are conserved signalling elements utilized in many intracellular signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic organisms [1]. Each MAPK module is activated by specific types of stimuli to induce specific adaptive response.

The forensic mental health in-reach team, in co-operation with the prison health service followed the ‘spiral’ of planning, action and fact finding about the results of the action. In December 2010 a 10 bed High Support Unit (HSU) was established within the prison. During the first year, 96 prisoners were admitted. A third (35%) reported psychotic symptoms, 28% were referred due to the immediate risk of self-harm, 17% were accommodated for medical treatments and increased observation, 13% received specialised treatment by the Addiction Psychiatry team, 6% presented with emotional distress. One prisoner was accommodated on the HSU due to the acute risk he posed to others. A major mental illness was diagnosed in 29%, 20% required short-term increased support for crisis intervention and were found not to have a mental illness. A further 10% were deemed to be feigning symptoms of mental illness to seek refuge in the HSU. 7% had personality disorder as their primary diagnosis and 4% had a learning disability. Stratifying risk within the prison population through the provision of the HSU decreased the total episodes of seclusion in the prison by 59% (p < 0.001) in addition to providing a more effective psychiatric in-reach service to the prison. Pathways between the prison and the forensic psychiatric hospital saw no change in activity but improved continuity of care.',\n",

The baby is particularly prone to ascending cholangitis during the first weeks after the operation, and ascending cholangitis occurs in 30–60% of cases [70]. This infection may be severe and sometimes fulminant. Clinically there are signs of sepsis, recurrence of jaundice, acholic stools, and perhaps abdominal pain; blood cultures may be positive. Treatment consists of IV antibiotics during two to three weeks. Recurrent cholangitis may require continuous antibiotic prophylaxis. The number of cholangitic episodes has been shown to negatively influence the success of the Kasai operation [71–74]. It has been reported that the occurrence of cholangitis significantly reduces survival rate in patients with either good or inadequate bile flow [73]. The more frequent the episodes of cholangitis are, the greater the probability of cirrhosis and the poorer the outcome of the HPE [71, 74].',\n",

The most common sites of varices are the esophagus, the stomach, the jejunal site of the Roux loop anastomosis, and the anorectum. In case of portal hypertension, associated with progressive liver failure and/or persistent jaundice, LT is indicated. Yet, local treatment of oesophageal varices may be needed prior to LT, using endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy or band ligation [110]. If liver function is preserved and jaundice is absent, endoscopic therapy may be sufficient [111]. Surgical portosystemic shunts may be considered if liver function is still normal and there are no life-threatening varices [112]. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) are rather rarely used in BA patients; the procedure is technically difficult, mainly due to periportal fibrosis and, typical for BA, small portal veins. But a TIPS can temporarily help in the',\n",

While the physiopathology of this condition is not formally established, it is likely influenced by gut-derived vasodilative agents such as nitric oxide, glucagon, and platelet activating factor, which enter the systemic circulation through the portosystemic shunts, avoiding clearance by the liver [114, 115]. The hepatopulmonary syndrome, a complication typically encountered in the long-term followup of children with BA, may represent an indication for early LT even when liver function is preserved [116].',\n",

In two multicenter, crossover studies, oral PBC 20 mg or 40 mg given once daily was significantly more effective than placebo and as effective as naproxen sodium and ibuprofen in relieving abdominal pain in 93 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. As in patients with musculoskeletal disorders [120], the onset of analgesic effect was more than two times faster with PBC compared to uncomplexed piroxicam.

       "  'ground_truth': 'Acute postoperative pain differs from chronic pain because it is more transitory and affected by anxiety about the outcome of the surgical condition and often concern for suboptimal analgesia. Unfortunately, poorly controlled and persistent pain occurs after surgery and can be severe, which might increase the risk of a chronic pain state [161]. And indeed, for patients awaiting surgery, the possibility of severe acute postoperative pain is a major concern [162]. Uncontrolled postoperative pain can lead to delayed recovery from surgery, pulmonary dysfunction and hypoxia, and restriction of mobility with subsequent increased risk of thromboembolism. On the contrary, effective pain management improves patient satisfaction, decreases hospital stay, and shortens recovery of the postsurgical patient [161, 163].',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': 'So-called “noncalcemic” calcitriol analogues have been advocated to be superior to native calcitriol. The development of these compounds has been undertaken in an effort to find compounds that will suppress PTH in CKD patients with less risk for development of hypercalcemia than that with calcitriol. This was most important when calcium-containing gut phosphorus binders were widely used. With the advent of lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate, which is now widely used, this is less of an issue. These vitamin D analogues are catabolized much more quickly than calcitriol and have a very short half-life in blood due to diminished binding to vitamin D binding protein. The short half-life lessens the chance for hypercalcemia to develop from intestinal epithelial cell programming as only newly formed villar cells are affected by vitamin D metabolites. Various alternative mechanisms have been considered for “noncalcemic” actions of some calcitriol analogues, but the evidence for these is very weak. One of the potential down-sides to the use of these analogues is that because they bind somewhat poorly to the calcitriol receptor (VDR), large doses must be given to achieve the required level of PTH suppression; these large doses induce not only their own destruction, but also the catabolism of native calcitriol. Calcitriol analogues are much more expensive to use than calcitriol, which presently limits their application in veterinary medicine.',\n",

Paricalcitol (i) is another widely studied and prescribed vitamin D analogue used in human medicine.

       "  'ground_truth': 'At present, it is possible to study the ultrastructure of large numbers of synapses within 3D samples of brain tissue. Indeed, using combined focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM), it has been shown that virtually all synaptic junctions can be identified regardless of the plane of the section (Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009, 2013; Kreshuk et al., 2011; Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2013). Tissue preparation involves fixation in aldehydes, osmication, en bloc staining with uranyl acetate, dehydration, and embedding in Araldite. Stacks of serial images are then obtained by automated FIB/SEM (Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009). Since image segmentation, quantification, and analysis of synaptic junctions in these stacks are all labor-intensive procedures, we have developed ESPINA, a software tool that greatly facilitates and accelerates these processes (Morales et al., 2011a). ESPINA makes use of the fact that presynaptic and postsynaptic densities appear as dark, electron-dense structures under the electron microscope. ESPINA uses a gray-level threshold to extract all the voxels that fit the gray levels of the synaptic junction. The resulting 3D object is irregularly shaped and flattened, and includes both the pre- and postsynaptic densities and their outer contours (Figures 1A–H). Here we propose a method to extract the SAS, (equivalent to both the AZ and the PSD), from these reconstructed 3D volumes, based on the extraction of interior surfaces from volumetric representations.',\n",

Skeletonization algorithms (Hisada et al., 2001; Mellado et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2010) are simple to implement but, in our experience, they often require a final post-processing step that involves either a pruning operation or a surface reconstruction process. Thinning methods (Lam et al., 1992) eliminate external voxels from the 3D volume until a planar surface is obtained. Although they are also simple to implement and fast executions can be achieved, thinning methods do not preserve the topology of the object, and different results can be obtained depending on the order in which the voxels are removed. Voronoi diagram methods (Okabe et al., 2000) are based on partitioning and triangulating the 3D space. Internal surfaces can be obtained by incrementally removing triangles from the external surface of the volume. Voronoi diagram methods permit topology preservation, but they are computationally expensive in 3D, numerically unstable, and spurious branches must also be pruned at the end of the process.

In a 3D object, for each voxel, the label stores a value indicating the shortest distance to the external contour. The set of voxels with their corresponding distance labels constitute the distance map (Borgefors, 1986). By making use of the a priori knowledge about the shape of the synaptic junction, our problem can be simplified by first placing an initial planar seed or template intersecting the 3D object at the appropriate location, and then deforming this plane according to the shape of the synaptic junction and the distance map values. This approach provides a free-form surface, the SAS, which should fulfill the following criteria: (i) The SAS should lie entirely within the reconstructed synaptic junction, equidistant to its pre- and postsynaptic faces. (ii) The curvature of the SAS should reproduce the curvature of the 3D segmentation of the synaptic junction. (iii) The external perimeter of the SAS should reproduce the external perimeter of the segmentation, as well as the holes that occasionally appear in perforated synaptic junctions.',\n",

Sporadic human infections continue to occur in countries where A(H5N1) viruses have become endemic in birds, providing a persistent threat to global health due to the possibility of virus adaptation towards efficient transmission among humans and ensuing pandemic spread. Recent evidence from experiments with ferrets, a widely accepted animal model for influenza in humans, suggest that only a limited number of genetic changes is needed for airborne transmission of H5N1 viruses (Imai et al., 2012; Herfst et al., 2012). Thus, monitoring of genetic changes, especially during human infections, and studying the relevance of such changes for human adaptation remains essential.',\n",

       "  'ground_truth': \"The molecular mechanisms that allow avian influenza viruses to cross the species barrier from birds to humans are incompletely understood. However, a prerequisite for efficient transmission of avian viruses between humans is a change from preferential recognition by the virus hemagglutinin (HA) of α2-3-sialylgalactose-terminating host cell receptors, predominant in avian respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia, to those terminating in α2-6-sialyl-galactose, which predominate in the human upper respiratory tract (Rogers and Paulson, 1983; Rogers and D'Souza, 1989). Accordingly, HAs of the 20th century pandemic viruses (H1N1 in 1918, H2N2 in 1957, and H3N2 in 1968) evolved from their original recognition of avian α2-3-sialyl- to preferential α2-6-sialyl-receptor binding (Connor et al., 1994; Matrosovich et al., 2000; Glaser et al., 2005; Stevens et al., 2006b; Tumpey et al., 2007). Thus to better understand the nature and significance of such adaptive changes, it is essential to monitor HA changes that may affect receptor specificity of avian influenza viruses, particularly during human infection.\",\n",

We detected patterns indicative of changes in receptor specificity in three human H5N1 isolates. Our analyses of these viruses and their egg-passaged counterparts indicated a rapid emergence of adaptive receptor-binding variants of H5N1 virus, and also demonstrated that marked discrepancies can occur in quasispecies distributions between clinical specimens and cell culture- or egg-grown viruses, thus emphasizing the need for genetic monitoring directly in clinical specimens.',\n",

Indeed, after passaging the viruses five times in the allantois of embryonated chicken eggs, which contain only α2-3-sialyl receptors (Ito et al., 1997b), all three viruses (re)gained efficient agglutination of horse RBCs (Table 1). Passage in eggs did not, however, alter the agglutination patterns of other avian influenza viruses isolated from humans or poultry or seasonal human influenza viruses (Table 1). Plaque assays showed that the MDCK cell isolate and egg passaged variant of A/Vietnam/CL1/2004 and A/Vietnam/CL105/2005 exhibited similar growth characteristics in MDCK cells.',\n",

A single amino acid difference was observed in the HA of each egg-grown virus (Table 2): Asp186Glu in A/Vietnam/CL1/2004, Val134Ala in A/Vietnam/CL105/2005, and Phe151Leu in A/Vietnam/CL2009C/2005 (H5 numbering). Changes in the first two viruses represented reversions to the avian H5 consensus sequence following egg passage. The consensus residue at position 151 is Ile rather than Leu. Interestingly, sequence analysis in the original clinical specimen revealed a subpopulation of 151Ile and not Leu (see below).',\n",

If so, it is possible that upregulated pancreatic ghrelin compensates lack of stomach-derived ghrelin and',\n",
